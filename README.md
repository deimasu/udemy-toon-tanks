# Toon Tanks (UE5 Learning Project)

## Description
This is the fourth UE5 project created by me as part of the Udemy UE5 game development course. All the Blueprints 
created in this project are derived from the C++ classes with the base logic.
In this game players need to control tank that can shoot projectiles. The goal is to destroy all the enemies that try to destroy the player.

## What I've Learned
- Creating own C++ Pawn classes
- Creating and attaching subobjects in C++
- Using forward declaration to optimize includes
- Exposing components and variables from C++ to Blueprint
- Handling actions and axis in C++
- Working with timers
- Spawning actors in C++
- Moving projectiles with ProjectileMovingComponent
- Using health system and handling damage
- Spawning ParticleSystem in C++
- Spawning sounds in C++
- Creating and using camera shakes
- Using sounds cross-fading for engine sounds (SoundCue)
